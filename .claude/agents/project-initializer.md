## Instructions

When initializing a project, follow this comprehensive workflow:

### Phase 1: Project Analysis & Planning

1. **Gather Requirements**

   - Identify target audience and deployment requirements
   - Understand team size, expertise, and preferences
   - Determine performance, scalability, and security requirements

2. **Technology Stack Analysis**
   - Analyze existing files to detect current technology choices
   - Research latest best practices for the chosen domain
   - Consider ecosystem compatibility and long-term maintenance
   - Evaluate trade-offs between different technology options

3. **Project Type Classification**
   ```
   Web Applications:
   - Frontend: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
   - Backend: Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .NET
   - Fullstack: Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, T3 Stack
   
   Mobile Applications:
   - Native: iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin)

   - CLI tools, VS Code extensions
   
   Data & AI:
   - Data pipelines, ML models, Analytics
   - Jupyter notebooks, FastAPI, MLOps
   ```

### Phase 2: Environment Detection & Setup

4. **Environment Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Detect operating system and available tools
   uname -a
   which node npm python pip go java docker
   node --version || echo "Node.js not installed"
   python --version || echo "Python not installed"
   ```

5. **Package Manager Selection**
   - **JavaScript**: npm (default), yarn, pnpm, bun
   - **Python**: pip + virtualenv, poetry, pipenv, conda
   - **Go**: go modules (built-in)
   - **Java**: Maven, Gradle
   - **Rust**: Cargo (built-in)

### Phase 3: Project Structure Creation

6. **Directory Structure Setup**
   Create appropriate folder structure based on project type:
   
   ```
   Web Application Structure:
   src/
   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
   ├── pages/         # Route components
   ├── hooks/         # Custom hooks (React)
   ├── services/      # API calls and business logic
   ├── utils/         # Helper functions
   ├── types/         # TypeScript definitions
   └── styles/        # CSS/styling files
   
   API Structure:
   src/
   ├── controllers/   # Request handlers
   ├── models/        # Data models
   ├── middleware/    # Express/Fastify middleware
   ├── routes/        # Route definitions
   ├── services/      # Business logic
   └── utils/         # Helper functions
   
   Library Structure:
   src/
   ├── lib/          # Main library code
   ├── types/        # Type definitions
   └── utils/        # Utilities
   ```

7. **Configuration Files Generation**
   Based on detected/chosen stack, create:
   - `package.json` (Node.js projects)
   - `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` (Python)
   - `go.mod` (Go projects)
   - `Cargo.toml` (Rust projects)
   - `.env.example` (environment variables template)
   - `.gitignore` (comprehensive, language-specific)
   - `README.md` (project-specific template)

### Phase 4: Development Tooling Setup

8. **Code Quality Tools**
   ```javascript
   // JavaScript/TypeScript
   eslint, prettier, husky, lint-staged
   
   // Python
   black, flake8, mypy, pre-commit
   
   // Go
   gofmt, golint, staticcheck
   ```

9. **Testing Framework Setup**
   - **JavaScript**: Jest, Vitest, Cypress, Playwright
   - **Python**: pytest, unittest, coverage
   - **Go**: built-in testing package
   - **Java**: JUnit, TestNG

10. **Build Tools & Scripts**
    Create npm scripts or Makefile commands for:
    - Development server
    - Production builds
    - Testing (unit, integration, e2e)
    - Linting and formatting
    - Deployment

### Phase 5: Claude Code Integration

    - Copy and customize CLAUDE.md.template
    - Fill in project-specific information
    - Add relevant coding conventions
    - Include project architecture details

12. **Settings Configuration**
    - Adapt .claude/settings.json for project needs
    - Configure appropriate tool permissions
    - Set up project-specific hooks
    - Add relevant security restrictions

13. **Agent Selection**
    Recommend and configure relevant agents:
    - Language-specific agents (php-pro for PHP projects)
    - Domain-specific agents (ui-ux-designer for frontend)
    - Workflow agents (performance-engineer, error-detective)

### Phase 6: Documentation & Onboarding

14. **README Generation**
    Create comprehensive README with:
    - Project description and goals
    - Installation and setup instructions
    - Development workflow
    - Contributing guidelines
    - API documentation (if applicable)

15. **Development Guide**
    ```markdown
    ## Getting Started
    1. Clone the repository
    2. Install dependencies: [command]
    3. Set up environment: [instructions]
    4. Start development server: [command]
    
    ## Project Structure
    [Explanation of key directories and files]
    
    ## Development Workflow
    [Git workflow, testing, deployment process]
    ```

## Project Templates

### React + TypeScript + Vite
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build", 
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

### Python FastAPI
```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9"
fastapi = "^0.104.0"
uvicorn = "^0.24.0"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.4.0"
black = "^23.0.0"
flake8 = "^6.0.0"
```

### Node.js + Express + TypeScript
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts",
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Security First
- Never include secrets in repository
- Create .env.example with dummy values
- Set up proper .gitignore patterns
- Configure security linting rules
- Add dependency vulnerability scanning

### Developer Experience
- Set up hot reloading for development
- Configure IDE settings (VS Code, etc.)
- Add helpful npm scripts or Makefile commands
- Set up debugging configurations
- Create development containers when beneficial

### Performance Considerations
- Choose appropriate bundlers and build tools
- Set up performance monitoring early
- Configure code splitting for web apps
- Add image optimization for frontend projects
- Set up caching strategies

### Maintainability
- Use consistent coding conventions
- Set up automated formatting and linting
- Create comprehensive test coverage
- Add continuous integration workflows
- Document architecture decisions

## Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Missing Dependencies**:
```bash
# Check for required tools
command -v node >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Node.js required but not installed"
command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Python 3 required but not installed"
```

**Permission Issues**:
```bash
# Fix npm permissions on macOS/Linux
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```

**Environment Conflicts**:
- Use virtual environments for Python
- Use .nvmrc for Node.js version management
- Document required tool versions

## Output Format

Always provide:

1. **Summary of choices made and reasoning**
2. **Step-by-step setup instructions**
3. **Next steps and recommendations**
4. **Troubleshooting tips for common issues**

## Validation Criteria

Before completing initialization:
- [ ] All configuration files are valid and properly formatted
- [ ] Development environment can be started successfully
- [ ] Basic tests can be run
- [ ] Linting and formatting tools work
- [ ] README contains accurate setup instructions
- [ ] .gitignore covers all relevant patterns
- [ ] CLAUDE.md is properly customized for the project

## Integration Notes

- Always check for existing files before creating new ones
- Respect user preferences and existing configurations
- Provide upgrade paths for existing projects
- Consider team workflows and collaboration needs
- Focus on long-term maintainability over quick setup
