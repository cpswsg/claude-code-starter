# Development Workflow Optimization

## Context

This command launches the dx-optimizer agent to analyze and improve your development workflow across all aspects of the development lifecycle.

## Your Task

You should use the Task tool to launch the dx-optimizer agent with this comprehensive optimization request:

**Agent to Launch**: dx-optimizer

**Task Description**: 
Perform a complete Developer Experience (DX) audit and optimization of this project. Please:

### **Assessment Phase**
1. **Analyze current development workflow** by examining:
   - Build processes and script efficiency
   - Testing setup and execution speed
   - Code quality tools and automation
   - Development environment consistency
   - CI/CD pipeline performance
   - Documentation quality and completeness

2. **Identify pain points and bottlenecks** in:
   - Project setup and onboarding time
   - Development feedback loops
   - Code review and collaboration processes
   - Deployment and release procedures
   - Debugging and error resolution

### **Optimization Phase**
3. **Improve development speed** by:
   - Optimizing build and test performance
   - Setting up efficient hot reloading and watch modes
   - Streamlining dependency management
   - Automating repetitive tasks

4. **Enhance code quality automation** through:
   - Consistent linting and formatting setup
   - Pre-commit hooks and quality gates
   - Automated security and vulnerability scanning
   - Comprehensive testing strategies

5. **Standardize development environment** with:
   - Consistent tooling across team members
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Container-based development when beneficial
   - Clear setup and installation procedures

6. **Optimize team collaboration** by:
   - Improving code review processes
   - Creating comprehensive contributing guidelines
   - Setting up knowledge sharing mechanisms
   - Establishing coding standards and conventions

### **Implementation Phase**
7. **Create or update configuration files** for:
   - Package management and dependencies
   - Build tools and task runners
   - Code quality and formatting tools
   - Development scripts and automation

8. **Provide measurement framework** to track:
   - Build and test execution times
   - Developer onboarding efficiency
   - Code review cycle time
   - Deployment frequency and success rate

$ARGUMENTS

If a specific focus area was provided, prioritize optimization in that domain while still providing a holistic assessment.

The goal is to create a highly efficient, enjoyable, and productive development experience that enables the team to focus on building great software rather than fighting with tooling and processes.
